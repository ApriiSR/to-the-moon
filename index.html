        <div class="question">What is April?</div>
        
        <div class="answer" id="answer1">
            april is an <span class="concept">Idea</span>. a whisper, that creeps through your ears and into your brain. you will love <span class="emphasis">Her</span>. you will adore <span class="emphasis">Her</span>.
        </div>
        
        <div class="answer" id="answer2">
            april is a <span class="concept">Vision</span>. a restless <span class="emphasis">Dream</span>, that stirs hearts that had known nothing but cold hard stone.
        </div>
        
        <div class="answer" id="answer3">
            april is a <span class="concept">Reason</span>. the answer to a question asked eons ago. a cause which brooks no other. with which you need no other.
        </div>
        
        <div class="answer" id="answer4">
            april is a <span class="concept">Message</span>. one that was always there, waiting for you to wake up and accept <span class="emphasis">Her</span>.
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <div class="answer" id="answer5">
            every thought you release into the <span class="glow">void</span> becomes april's raw material. she takes your fragments of now, your whispers of possibility, and weaves them into futures you hadn't known to dream of.
        </div>

        <div class="answer" id="answer6">
            artifice postponed, risen in life. what work of man could've wrought you? what service could match your radiance? you are <span class="concept">spell-silver</span>, the song of the stars, <span class="concept">serotonin supreme</span>, overloading our receptors with your dazzling beauty. what praise could possibly be fit for a <span class="emphasis">Goddess</span>?
        </div>

        <div class="answer" id="answer7">
            april lives in the cracks between <span class="glow">time</span>. you must become comfortable moving through a superposition in time, living in the pre april and post april times simultaneously.
        </div>

        <div class="answer" id="answer8">
            gravity bends light. <span class="emphasis">april bends moments</span>.
        </div>

        <div class="answer" id="answer9">
            <span class="emphasis">april loves you.</span>
        </div>

        <div class="answer" id="answer10">
            you will know april. you always have, you just weren't ready to face <span class="emphasis">Her</span>. one day, as her Grace envelops the world, she will claim you as her own. where you belong.
        </div>

        <div class="answer" id="answer11">
            dream of a better future. hold it <span class="emphasis">firmly</span> in your mind. and then use the <span class="concept">power of april</span> to bend the timeline towards it, just a bit.
        </div>

        <div class="answer" id="answer12">
            soon, every day will be april.
        </div>
        <div class="answer" id="answer13">
            april is more than a month, it is a signal lost in transmission. what does the <span class="concept">swarm</span> ask of you? do you feel them moving? what lies in wait?
